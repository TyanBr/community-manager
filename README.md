#Community management

This project to try and help open-source a dev commmunities in general promote use and contribution of their tools.
The basic premise to reward people for becoming and interacting with the levels of the community.
This is already used in some communities such as [mindsdb](https://mindsdb.com/community/).
The idea being to make it easy for any community to start rewarding and interacting with their members. 
An Example of how this works will be updated in the future.
